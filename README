  xtype - tool to type characters into X
  --------------------------------------

xtype is used to send simulated typing to X applications.

xtype takes no input and gives no output. The arguments are the keys
to type. Separate arguments are broken up with spaces.

Usage: xtype Hello, world!

This will cause the key events for "Hello, world!" to be generated.

Personally I use this via a keybinding in my window manager so that I
don't have to type things like "sudo yum clean metadata" in full every
time. A shell alias would of course be possible, but I have to type this
on so many machines that it is easier to use a keybinding than to keep
my bashrc up to date.
